# License Choice

The State of the Netherlands has chosen to publish the source code of the Notification App under the European Union Public License (EUPL).

This was because the State of the Netherlands had a few relevant considerations when developing the Notification App. 

On the one hand, it was considered important that the operation of the Notification App could be assessed by everyone. On the other hand, it was considered important that the open source community could contribute to the development of the Notification App. Moreover, given the nature of the Notification App, it was not considered desirable for third parties to be able to exclusively appropriate the source code of the Notification App in any way. The EUPL, a so-called "copyleft" licence, reflects these considerations.

In addition, the EUPL has been developed by the European Commission to publish government software and is in accordance with the national law of all EU member states. This makes the EUPL a suitable license for publishing the source code of the Notification App.

### Contributor License Agreement

The State of the Netherlands has also drawn up a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for contributions to the Notification App from the open source community. 

The purpose of the CLA is to provide clarity about the allocation of intellectual property rights in the Notification App. The CLA itself is licensed under the CC0 license. 

By explicitly agreeing on the terms for the contribution to the Notification App, potential disputes about intellectual property rights are prevented as much as possible.
